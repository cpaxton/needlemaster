# Needle Master

Needle Master is an Android game developed by Chris Paxton. The idea is that players need to steer a needle through a sequence of gates, hitting as many as possible before reaching the end of the level and going off the right side of the screen.

## Play It

I published the game on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.jhu.lcsr.needlemaster).

## Data Files

There are a bunch of text files saved in ```needle_master_trials``` on your Android device. You can export these and use another library to download them. I've written a couple tools that convert the data into the correct format.

  * [Needle Master Tools](https://github.com/cpaxton/needle_master_tools) will let you load the data in Python in the correct format.
